#### Setup

The following files/directories are expected:

+ galaxy_catalog.fits
+ previous_galaxy_zoo_subjects.csv
+ fits (dir)
+ calibration_jpeg (dir)

The names of each can be set in the main file, upload_decals.py

If you've run the DECaLS download, you should already have a galaxy catalog, fits directory and jpeg directory.

The expert catalog of Nair 2010 can be found (here)[http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/ApJS/186/427]
Download all rows as fits (binary) and check the columns 'bar' and 'ring'. Other necessary columns are checked by default.
